### _a minimal and AMP-compatible hugo theme_

**Ample** is a Hugo theme based on [Milano](https://github.com/oneleaftea/milano), which is itself a fork of [Xmin](https://xmin.yihui.name/) by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name). In the spirit of its ancestors, and to remain compliant with the restrictions of [Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://www.ampproject.org/), this theme does not use any javascript and employs only minimal CSS, but adds the benefits of AMP and SEO data.

In addition to the combined features of Milano and Xmin, several features have been added:

* Added AMP-specific **boilerplate and configuration**.
* Switched to [Hugo Pipes](https://gohugo.io/hugo-pipes/introduction/) to **concat** and **minify** custom CSS.
* Some modifications to the overall look and style.

As with Xmin, it is fully functional. It supports pages (including the home page), blog posts, a navigation menu, categories, tags, and RSS.
